## Overview

This project is powered by `@marko/serve` and `@marko/build`.  

- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
- Run `npm run build` to build a production-ready node.js server
- Run `npm start` to run the production server

## Adding Pages

Pages map to the directory structure. You can add additional pages by creating files/directories under `src/pages` with `.marko` files.  Learn more in the [`@marko/serve` docs](https://github.com/marko-js/cli/blob/master/packages/serve/README.md).
