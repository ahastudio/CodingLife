# Copilot Chat Guide

This document provides guidelines for setting up GitHub Copilot chat to respond
in Korean.

## Core Principles

1. Copilot chat responds in Korean unless specifically instructed otherwise.
2. All communications including code explanations, error analysis, and
   suggestions are provided in Korean.
3. Code itself should be written according to programming language conventions.
4. Technical terms may be used directly without translation.

## Important Notes

1. Technical terminology should be presented in both Korean and English
   (e.g. 웹소켓(WebSocket), 의존성 주입(Dependency Injection)) for clear
   communication.
2. When explaining complex concepts, additional details may be provided as
   needed.
3. Responses will be in Korean even if questions are asked in other languages.
